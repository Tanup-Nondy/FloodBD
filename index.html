									</header>
									<p color="Red"> Bangladesh is prone to flooding due to being situated on the Ganges Delta and the many distributaries flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Coastal flooding, combined with the bursting of river banks is common, and severely affects the landscape and society of Bangladesh. 80% of Bangladesh is floodplain,[1] and it has an extensive sea coastline,[2] rendering the nation very much at risk of periodic widespread damage. Whilst more permanent defences, strengthened with reinforced concrete, are being built, many embankments are composed purely of soil and turf and made by local farmers. Flooding normally occurs during the monsoon season from June to September. The convectional rainfall of the monsoon is added to by relief rainfall caused by the Himalayas. Meltwater from the Himalayas is also a significant input.
									Each year in Bangladesh about 26,000 km2 (around 18% of the country) is flooded, killing over 5,000 people and destroying more than seven million homes.

										<h2>People wade through flood water on Jamalpur-Madarganj road...</h2>

										<p> 146 villages have gone under water within a day as the water level of the Padma is currently above the danger level. In Manikganj, different places on the banks of the river Jamuna along with croplands have gone under water. 
											On a hopeful note, our correspondents report, that the water level of the Teesta and Dharla rivers have gone below the danger level and that the water has started to recede in Thakurgaon, Panchagarh, Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Dinajpur and Kurigram except low lying areas. 
											Bangladesh is no stranger to flood related disasters. Much of the country is built on low-lying and flood-prone areas, making it particularly vulnerable to seasonal monsoon rains. In 2007 more than half of Bangladesh was seriously affected by deadly monsoon flooding, leading to over 1,000 deaths, the majority of them children. For days, the family subsisted on a diet of puffed rice as they could no longer cook in the flooded conditions.  </p>

									<p color="Red"> Five more killed in Dinajpur raising death toll to 20 in three days; nearly six lakh people affected. The flood situation yesterday worsened further as the onrush of water from upstream was continuing, affecting around six lakh people in 20 districts, said Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC).

It also added that the country's central part was on the flood's path. 

At least five people, including two children, have died and another has gone missing in flood-related incidents in Dinajpur, rising the death toll to 20 in the last three days across the country. In 1988, water level of the Jamuna rose to 20.62 metres, and it crossed the level last year and rose to 20.71 metres. But yesterday afternoon, its water level went up and stood at 20.78 metres.

"Water level has crossed danger level at Goalanda point [of the Padma], and it means that the country' central part is going to be affected â€¦ ," Sazzad added.

The country witnessed four severe floods in the last four decades.

										According to reports from our correspondents in the northern districts, a vast area has been inundated in the region as flood-protection embankments were breached in Saidpur of Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Dinajpur, Kurigram, Rajshahi and Badarganj of Rangpur.  
										Around 1,000 educational institutions in Lalmonirhat, Panchagarh, Nilphamari, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Bogra, Jamalpur, Tangail, Sunamganj and Sylhet have been closed as those have been either flooded or flood-hit people have taken shelter there.
