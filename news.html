										<p>Bangladesh</p>
										<h2>Over 5.7 million affected by floods in Bangladesh...</h2>
									</header>
									<p color="Red"> Bangladesh is prone to flooding due to being situated on the Ganges Delta and the many distributaries flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Coastal flooding, combined with the bursting of river banks is common, and severely affects the landscape and society of Bangladesh. 80% of Bangladesh is floodplain,[1] and it has an extensive sea coastline,[2] rendering the nation very much at risk of periodic widespread damage. Whilst more permanent defences, strengthened with reinforced concrete, are being built, many embankments are composed purely of soil and turf and made by local farmers. Flooding normally occurs during the monsoon season from June to September. The convectional rainfall of the monsoon is added to by relief rainfall caused by the Himalayas. Meltwater from the Himalayas is also a significant input.
									Each year in Bangladesh about 26,000 km2 (around 18% of the country) is flooded, killing over 5,000 people and destroying more than seven million homes. During severe floods the affected area may exceed 75% of the country, as was seen in 1998. This volume is 95% of the total annual inflow. By comparison, only about 187,000 million m3, of stream flow is generated by rainfall inside the country during the same period. The floods have caused devastation in Bangladesh throughout history, especially during the years 1966, 1987, 1988 and 1998. The 2007 South Asian floods also affected a large portion of Bangladesh.
									 In rural areas across northern Bangladesh families are preparing to mark Eid al-Adha, one of the holiest dates on the Muslim calendar.
									The holiday, which translates literally as the "sacrifice feast," is intended to be a time of great celebration. In small villages and towns, such as Beraberi some 134 kilometers northwest of Dhaka, residents spent much of the last year hand-rearing goats and cows in anticipation of the annual festivities, so we should help them.

										<h2>Dinajpur flood latest update August 2017/ Flood destroys everything Dinajpur ...</h2>
									</header>
										<p> 146 villages have gone under water within a day as the water level of the Padma is currently above the danger level. In Manikganj, different places on the banks of the river Jamuna along with croplands have gone under water. 
											On a hopeful note, our correspondents report, that the water level of the Teesta and Dharla rivers have gone below the danger level and that the water has started to recede in Thakurgaon, Panchagarh, Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Dinajpur and Kurigram except low lying areas. 
											“I got a quarter kilogram of flattened rice (Chira) as relief in last four days”, alleged Jyoti Bala Roy, 62, of Maljhar village, who took shelter at Maljhar Government Primary School under Biral upazila of Dinajpur on Saturday when her village flooded.
											Like her, many flood affected people of Biral upazila of Dinajpur are still without access to government relief.   
											According to reports from our correspondents in the northern districts, a vast area has been inundated in the region as flood-protection embankments were breached in Saidpur of Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Dinajpur, Kurigram, Rajshahi and Badarganj of Rangpur.  
											Around 1,000 educational institutions in Lalmonirhat, Panchagarh, Nilphamari, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Bogra, Jamalpur, Tangail, Sunamganj and Sylhet have been closed as those have been either flooded or flood-hit people have taken shelter there. Bangladesh is no stranger to flood related disasters. Much of the country is built on low-lying and flood-prone areas, making it particularly vulnerable to seasonal monsoon rains. In 2007 more than half of Bangladesh was seriously affected by deadly monsoon flooding, leading to over 1,000 deaths, the majority of them children. For days, the family subsisted on a diet of puffed rice as they could no longer cook.  </p>
